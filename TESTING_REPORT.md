# Collabie Application Testing Report

## Overview
This document summarizes the testing performed on the Collabie application, which includes a Discord-style server and channel system with Trello-style boards.

## Features Tested Programmatically

### 1. User Authentication System
✅ **Status: Working**
- User registration with validation
- User login with email or username
- JWT token generation and validation
- User profile retrieval and update

### 2. Friend System
✅ **Status: Working**
- Sending friend requests
- Accepting friend requests
- Viewing friends list
- Viewing pending requests

### 3. Messaging System
✅ **Status: Working**
- Sending messages between friends
- Retrieving message history
- Message formatting and storage

## Features to Test Manually

### 1. Server and Channel System (GraphQL)
**Components:**
- Server creation and management
- Channel creation (text, board, voice)
- Role-based permissions
- Invite system

**How to Test:**
1. Use GraphQL Playground at `http://localhost:3001/graphql`
2. Authenticate with a valid JWT token
3. Execute mutations to create servers and channels
4. Verify data is stored correctly in MongoDB

### 2. Board System with Lists and Tasks
**Components:**
- Board creation for board channels
- List creation within boards
- Task creation and management
- Task movement between lists

**How to Test:**
1. Create a server with a board channel
2. Create a board for the channel
3. Add lists and tasks
4. Move tasks between lists
5. Verify real-time updates

### 3. Real-time Features (Socket.IO)
**Components:**
- Real-time messaging
- Online presence indicators
- Real-time board updates

**How to Test:**
1. Open the application in two browser windows
2. Log in as different users
3. Send messages and verify real-time delivery
4. Check online status indicators
5. Collaborate on a board and verify real-time updates

### 4. Voice/Video Calling
**Components:**
- Call initiation
- Call joining
- Call termination
- WebRTC signaling

**How to Test:**
1. Start a call between two users
2. Verify audio/video streams
3. Test call controls (mute, camera toggle)
4. End the call and verify cleanup

### 5. Frontend UI Integration
**Components:**
- User interface for all features
- State management with Zustand
- Responsive design

**How to Test:**
1. Navigate through all UI components
2. Verify responsive design on different screen sizes
3. Test all user flows (registration, login, messaging, etc.)
4. Check error handling and user feedback

## API Endpoints Verification

### REST API Endpoints
✅ **Status: Healthy**
- `GET /api/health` - Returns 200 OK
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- `POST /api/friends/request` - Send friend request
- `POST /api/friends/accept/{id}` - Accept friend request
- `POST /api/messages` - Send message
- `GET /api/messages/{userId1}/{userId2}` - Get messages

### GraphQL API Endpoints
✅ **Status: Accessible**
- `POST /graphql` - GraphQL endpoint
- Schema introspection working
- Authentication middleware in place

## Database Verification
✅ **Status: Functional**
- MongoDB connection established
- All models (User, Friend, Message, Server, Channel, Board) created
- Data persistence working correctly

## Real-time Communication
✅ **Status: Initialized**
- Socket.IO server running on port 3001
- WebRTC signaling initialized
- Chat sockets connected

## Performance and Security
✅ **Status: Configured**
- Rate limiting implemented (configured for testing)
- Helmet.js security middleware active
- CORS configured for localhost development
- JWT token authentication

## Recommendations for Further Testing

1. **Load Testing**: Test application performance under high load
2. **Security Testing**: Verify authentication and authorization boundaries
3. **Cross-browser Testing**: Test on different browsers and devices
4. **Integration Testing**: Test end-to-end user flows
5. **Error Handling**: Test edge cases and error conditions

## Conclusion
The core functionality of the Collabie application is working correctly. The authentication, friend, and messaging systems have been verified programmatically. The new server, channel, and board systems are implemented and ready for manual testing. All API endpoints are accessible and the database is functioning properly.
